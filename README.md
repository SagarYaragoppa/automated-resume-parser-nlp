# automated-resume-parser-nlp
An NLP-based information extraction system that processes unstructured resume documents (PDF and text) to extract structured entities such as candidate name, email, and skills. The pipeline combines text preprocessing, regex-based pattern matching, and pretrained spaCy NER models to generate machine-readable JSON outputs for downstream analysis.
